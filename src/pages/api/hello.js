With Doctoora, you can get to see any specialist that you need. Whether you're looking to see a specialist physically or virtually, Doctoora has you covered. For a visual specialty like Dermatology, I have found the virtual bookings convenient for both the patient and doctor and the results are comparable to a physical consultation. Their customer service is also topnotch- giving all the support to the specialists in good time.
